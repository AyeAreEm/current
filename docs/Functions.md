# Functions
The syntax for defining a function is:
```
<name> :: fn(<arg_name>: <arg_type>) <return_type>;
```
For example:
```
main :: fn(args: []string) void {}
```

## Named Arguments
In a function call, you can assign to a specific argument by doing `.<name> = `, like in compound literal assignments.
```
add :: fn(x: i64, y: i64) i64;
num := add(.y = 15, .x = 10);
```

## Default Values
When defining a function, the arguments can be given a default value. The value does NOT need to be known at compile time (the value will be generated by the callee).<br>
All values that weren't given by the callee will be the default value.
```
player_init :: fn(x := 0, y := 0, width := 16, height := 16, health := 10) Player;
player := player_init(.width = 32, .height = 32);
```

## External Functions
To inform the compiler that a function exists but isn't implemented in your codebase, you can use the `extern` keyword.

```
extern puts :: fn(s: cstring) i32;
puts(c"hello world");
```
